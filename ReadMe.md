<b>Data:</b> Science Challenge

<b>Task :</b> 001

## Objective:
 To assess the skills and capabilities of candidates/teams in data science, including their understanding and handling of data.


### Data: [AMP1_glucose_data.xlsx](AMP1_glucose_data.xlsx)

## Description:
 The provided data is glucose data from a FreeStyle Libre Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) spanning 14 days with a frequency of 15 minutes.

## Objectives

Part A: Understanding
- Write a summary explaining your understanding of CGM data.
- Provide a structured bullet-point list summarizing the data.

Part B: Data Structuring
- Identify any issues in the data file.
- Restructure the data for better usability.

Part C: Data Insights
- Manually observe and describe key points from the data.
- Generate visualizations and provide insights based on these visualizations.
- Identify patterns within the data on an hourly, daily, and 14-day basis.

Part D: Report Generation
